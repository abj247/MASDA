# Social-CADRL
Continuous Action-Value Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CADRL) stands as a pivotal component within our repository, specializing in the realm of social navigation. It is a cutting-edge framework that harnesses the power of reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to navigate complex social environments seamlessly. CADRL leverages continuous action-value distributional reinforcement learning techniques to imbue agents with the ability to make dynamic decisions while considering the presence and behaviors of other agents. 

To run CADRL experiments for Social mini games go to specified folder and choose the scenario to run. For example to simulate doorway scenario with CADRL use following command

``` 
cd ./Methods/Social-CADRL/experiments/src 
python doorway.py 
```

The animation file for the simulation will be saved at 
``` ./Methods/Social-CADRL/experiments/results/example/animations ```

With CADRL, our repository equips agents to make informed, real-time decisions in congested scenarios, such as doorways, hallways, and intersections, ensuring not only efficient movement but also social adherence. CADRL plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall safety and functionality of multi-agent systems in social navigation contexts, making it an indispensable tool within our collection of algorithms and methodologies.
